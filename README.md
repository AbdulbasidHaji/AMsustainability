# AMsustainability
This project investigates the sustainability of additive manufacturing (AM) processes by employing an innovative integration of ontology and big data analysis, addressing the urgent need for environmentally sustainable manufacturing methods that can support the customization benefits of AM. The research was motivated by the growing environmental and economic concerns associated with manufacturing, seeking to harness AM's potential for reducing waste and energy consumption. To achieve this, the study developed a comprehensive ontology that captures the complex relationships between AM processes, materials, and sustainability metrics like energy consumption, carbon footprint, and recyclability. This ontology-based framework facilitated the structured analysis of extensive datasets, enabling the identification of sustainable practices within AM. The project's main conclusion from case study conducted highlights the advantage of using ontology and big data for assessing sustainability in AM, demonstrating that this approach can significantly enhance decision-making processes for sustainable manufacturing during design stage. It presents the potential for ontology-based frameworks to provide detailed insights into the environmental and economic impacts of AM processes, offering a valuable tool for optimizing manufacturing practices towards greater sustainability.
